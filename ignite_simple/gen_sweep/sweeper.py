    """Performs the given architectural parameter search on the problem defined
    in the given module.

    :param str module_name: the path to the module which contains the
        model / dataset / loss / accuracy style, where the model accepts
        the parameters which are being swept (one argument per parameter).
    :param ParamSelector param_selector: what decides what parameters to be
        sent. Note that this is structured so it can utilize partial sweeps
        to inform further search, although the best performance requires
        that it can give more than one trial at a time.
    :param int sweep_cores: the number of cores that are used for sweeping
        parameters. This is important both for being able to replicate the
        results of the sweep and in terms of performance. If this number
        exceeds the number of physical cores, it will be simulated in a way
        that correctly utilizes the available resources.

        A higher number of sweep cores gives more accurate and consistent
        hyperparameters, which is essential for meaningful comparisons
        between architectures. 4 is a reasonable starting place.
    :param HyperparameterSettings hparams: either the hyperparameter settings
        to use or a name of a preset ('fastest', 'fast', 'slow', 'slowest')
        that is used for sweeping hyperparameters. This value will be modified
        to ensure we are simulating sweep_cores correctly if necessary.
    :param str folder: where to save the output to. the main output that
        one will typically want to use is

        folder/points/
            funcres.pt: contains a list of tuples where each tuple is
                of the form (params, lr_min, lr_max, bs, perf_train,
                loss_train, perf_val, loss_val). The performance and
                loss are expressed as an array with one element per
                trial.
            params_lookup.pt: contains a tuple of two dictionaries,
                where the first is params_to_ids and goes from a
                tuple of parameters to the corresponding name of
                the folder in folder/points which is the result
                of the model_manager train, and the second has
                the keys/values swapped (ids to params).

    This returns the unpickled content in folder/points/funcres.pt, which is
    a list of tuples of the form

    .. code:: python

        (params: tuple,
        lr_min: float,
        lr_max: float,
        bs: int,
        perf_train: np.ndarray #  (shape=(trials,)),
        loss_train: np.ndarray #  (shape=(trials,)),
        perf_val: np.ndarray #  (shape=(trials,)),
        loss_val: np.ndarray #  (shape=(trials,))
        )

    As is typical, loss is non-negative and lower is better. Performance is
    between 0 and 1 and higher is better.
